I already rambled about; what source code auditing is, why we do it, and its pros vs cons over dynamic analysis. So in this post i'll present some basic vulnerabilities we can look for in audits and how we might build a tool for their detection using simple pattern matching and rules.

## What are we Building?

<!-- Hows it different to graudit -->

## Making the POC
<!-- Making a POC -->

<!-- 
 + signatures  = regex patterns
 + grepping as a technique
 + making it more useful to the uninformed researcher or developer
    + descriptions, context

-->

## Writing Tests to Ward Off Falling into the Debugging Abysses 

<!-- Regression tests and methodology -->

## Technologies
<!-- rich -->

<!-- gcc -->

<!-- regexer || regex101 -->

<!-- pytest -->
