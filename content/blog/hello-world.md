# Computer Security Roadmap

## Introductions

Computer security is no longer a sacred art practiced by a few insular nerds, but rather a global issue
where large teams work together to improve the privacy and safety of all. It is a constant arms race of finding
chinks in the armour before those who would exploit them for personal gain. 

Here, in these blogs, and hopefully soon a youtube channel, I will explore the diverse field of security. These blogs
will read as collection of random ideas and topics inspired by things that I am working on or that peek my interest, 
rather than a series of structured articles.

## Why Would I Read This?

You have now read far enough to question why you are reading this blog article in your limited amount, of what I can only 
assume to be, spare time. Let me provide a somewhat anecdotal answer to illustrate the motivations behind this blog.

Some 4 years ago I was speaking to a guy who name-dropped "Kali Linux" and some tail about hacking the school Wi-Fi, what
an original story. That night I went home jumped on youtube and found a 15-hour-long tutorial on hacking with Kali Linux.
Over the course of my 2-week break I studied every night taking notes and working my way through the video. Once I finished 
I had a 45-page document of notes, a bootable USB and only the tiniest idea how to go about `hacking` anything.

Herein lies some (post obvious) wisdom: 'You can't learn to hack in 15 hours'. Several years on and im still a beginner,
 a novice in the art of computer security. What I do have are several take home lessons:

1. Everyone learns differently but hacking is definitely a practical art
2. Practice and theory complement each other like nothing else in security
3. There's always more to known
4. It's darn hard to find resources that don't leave out critical details for 
a beginner!
   
It is this last point that has inspired me to start trying to share the things I have learnt. Fueled by frustrations of 
the past and disappointment that exploration of a topic suddenly ends with "there are also many other ways to do xyz ..." 
leaving you with more questions than answers. Perhaps a good thing? Well yes it is true that to excel in this field one 
must be inquisitive by nature, seek out the answers solve problems for one's self, but if I can make that process easier
for someone then my goal is achieved. 

## TDLR

+ I will try to explore the topics that I do feature in full, laying the groundwork for understanding
and providing resources for additional detail where I fail to explain something myself

+ This blog will act as somewhat of a diary for the things I am learning at the given time


## Closing

If it goes well I plan to start a structured series of videos and articles that start with the fundamentals of
computer security and work up infinitely (as new techniques are developed) to meet current standards.
