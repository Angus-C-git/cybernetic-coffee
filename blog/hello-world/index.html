<p>Computer security is no longer a sacred art practiced by a few insular nerds, but rather a global issue
where large teams work together to improve the privacy and safety of all. It is a constant arms race of finding
chinks in the armour before those who would exploit them for personal gain.</p>
<p>Here, in these blogs, and hopefully soon a youtube channel, I will explore the diverse field of security. These blogs
will read as collection of random ideas and topics inspired by things that I am working on or that peek my interest,
rather than a series of structured articles.</p>
<h2 id="why-would-i-read-this">Why Would I Read This?</h2>
<p>You have now read far enough to question why you are reading this blog article in your limited amount, of what I can only
assume to be, spare time. Let me provide a somewhat anecdotal answer to illustrate the motivations behind this blog.</p>
<p>Some 4 years ago I was speaking to a guy who name-dropped &ldquo;Kali Linux&rdquo; and some tail about hacking the school Wi-Fi, what
an original story. That night I went home jumped on youtube and found a 15-hour-long tutorial on hacking with Kali Linux.
Over the course of my 2-week break I studied every night taking notes and working my way through the video. Once I finished
I had a 45-page document of notes, a bootable USB and only the tiniest idea how to go about <code>hacking</code> anything.</p>
<p>Herein lies some (post obvious) wisdom: &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t learn to hack in 15 hours&rsquo;. Several years on and im still a beginner,
a novice in the art of computer security. What I do have are several take home lessons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone learns differently but hacking is definitely a practical art</li>
<li>Practice and theory complement each other like nothing else in security</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s always more to known</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s darn hard to find resources that don&rsquo;t leave out critical details for
a beginner!</li>
</ol>
<p>It is this last point that has inspired me to start trying to share the things I have learnt. Fueled by frustrations of
the past and disappointment that exploration of a topic suddenly ends with &ldquo;there are also many other ways to do xyz &hellip;&rdquo;
leaving you with more questions than answers. Perhaps a good thing? Well yes it is true that to excel in this field one
must be inquisitive by nature, seek out the answers solve problems for one&rsquo;s self, but if I can make that process easier
for someone then my goal is achieved.</p>
<h2 id="tdlr">TDLR</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I will try to explore the topics that I do feature in full, laying the groundwork for understanding
and providing resources for additional detail where I fail to explain something myself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This blog will act as somewhat of a diary for the things I am learning at the given time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>If it goes well I plan to start a structured series of videos and articles that start with the fundamentals of
computer security and work up infinitely (as new techniques are developed) to meet current standards.</p>
