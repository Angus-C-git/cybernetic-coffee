      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d think after searching for /bin/sh in libc that many times in pwntools that I&amp;rsquo;d remember the syntax. But actually my brain is too busy remembering when the milk in the fridge expires. Here&amp;rsquo;s a collection of my favorite forgotten syntactic gems for pwntools.
General flat payload = flat({ # pad with garbage to this offset cyclic_find(&amp;#39;amia&amp;#39;): rop.chain() }) custom filler
alphabet = &amp;#39;bcdefhijklmnopqrstuvwyz&amp;#39; # cleansed alphabet payload = fit({ cyclic_find(&amp;#39;nbbb&amp;#39;, alphabet=bet): rop.</description>

      <description>Overview Stack based buffer overflows are old as fuck. Like I was literally dead when the most advanced techniques for exploiting them were conceived. However pwntools is a exploitation framework that has been around for a much shorter period of time and adds a new level of simplicity which makes exploit development more approachable. Of course there exist a great number of better binary exploitation courses and guides, a few of which I will link in the resources section bellow.</description>
